    "description": "You can find House Sparrows most places where there are houses (or other buildings), and few places where there aren’t. Along with two other introduced species, the European Starling and the Rock Pigeon, these are some of our most common birds. Their constant presence outside our doors makes them easy to overlook, and their tendency to displace native birds from nest boxes causes some people to resent them. But House Sparrows, with their capacity to live so intimately with us, are just beneficiaries of our own success.",
    "cool_facts": [
      "The House Sparrow was introduced into Brooklyn, New York, in 1851. By 1900 it had spread to the Rocky Mountains. Two more introductions in the early 1870s, in San Francisco and Salt Lake City, aided the bird’s spread throughout the West. House Sparrows are now common across all of North America except Alaska and far northern Canada.",
      "The House Sparrow takes frequent dust baths. It throws soil and dust over its body feathers, just as if it were bathing with water. In doing so, a sparrow may make a small depression in the ground, and sometimes defends this spot against other sparrows.",
      "The House Sparrow prefers to nest in manmade structures such as eaves or walls of buildings, street lights, and nest boxes instead of in natural nest sites such as holes in trees.",
      "Due to its abundance, ease to raise and general lack of fear towards humans, the House Sparrow has proved to be an excellent model organism for many avian biological studies. To date, there have been almost 5,000 scientific papers published with the House Sparrow as the study species.",
      "House Sparrows aggressively defend their nest holes. A scientist in 1889 reported cases of House Sparrows attacking 70 different bird species. House Sparrows sometimes evict other birds from nest holes, including Eastern Bluebirds, Purple Martins, and Tree Swallows.",
      "House Sparrows in flocks have a pecking order much the way chickens in a farmyard do. You can begin to decipher the standings by paying attention to the black throats of the males. Males with larger patches of black tend to be older and dominant over males with less black. By wearing this information on their feathers, sparrows can avoid some fights and thereby save energy.",
      "House Sparrows have been seen stealing food from American Robins and piercing flowers to drain them of nectar.",
      "The oldest recorded House Sparrow was a female, and at least 15 years, 9 months old when she was found in Texas in 2004, the same state where she had been banded."

You won’t find them in extensive woodlands, forests, or grasslands. In extreme environments such as deserts or the far north, House Sparrows survive only in the immediate vicinity of people.Back to top",
      "food": "House Sparrows eat mostly grains and seeds, as well as livestock feed and, in cities, discarded food. Among the crops they eat are corn, oats, wheat, and sorghum. Wild foods include ragweed, crabgrass and other grasses, and buckwheat. House Sparrows readily eat birdseed including millet, milo, and sunflower seeds. Urban birds readily eat commercial bird seed. In summer, House Sparrows eat insects and feed them to their young. They catch insects in the air, by pouncing on them, or by following lawnmowers or visiting lights at dusk.Back to top",
      "behavior": "House Sparrows hop rather than walk on the ground. They are social, feeding in crowded flocks and squabbling over crumbs or seeds on the ground. House Sparrows are a common sight at bird feeders; you may also see them bathing in street-side puddles or dustbathing on open ground, ruffling their feathers and flicking water or dust over themselves with similar motions. From living in such close company, House Sparrows have developed many ways of indicating dominance and submission. Nervous birds flick their tails. Aggravated birds crouch with the body horizontal, shove their head forward and partially spread and roll forward their wings, and hold the tail erect. This can intensify to a display with wings lifted, crown and throat feathers standing on end, tail fanned, and beak open. Males with larger amounts of black on the throat tend to dominate over males with less black. When males display to a prospective mate, they fluff up their chest, hold their wings partially open, fan the tail, and hop stiffly in front of the female, turning sideways and sometimes bowing up and down. Sometimes, other males who spot such a display in progress will fly in and begin displaying as well. In flocks, males tend to dominate over females in fall and winter, but females assert themselves in spring and summer.Back to top",
      "nesting": "House Sparrows nest in holes of buildings and other structures such as streetlights, gas-station roofs, signs, and the overhanging fixtures that hold traffic lights. They sometimes build nests in vines climbing the walls of buildings. House Sparrows are strong competitors for nest boxes, too, at times displacing the species the nest box was intended for, such as bluebirds and Tree Swallows. House Sparrows nest in holes in trees somewhat less often.",
      "conservation": "House Sparrow populations have declined by about 3% per year resulting in a cumulative decline of nearly 80% between 1966 and 2019, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates a global breeding population of 740 million and rates them 9 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Scale, indicating a species of low conservation concern. House Sparrows are fierce competitors for nest holes in trees and nest boxes. These are valuable commodities for birds that require them for breeding and unfortunately, nonnative House Sparrows squeeze out some of our native cavity-nesting species. After becoming common in North American cities where they were intentionally released in the nineteenth century, House Sparrows colonized farmyards and barns during the twentieth century. With the recent industrialization of farms, House Sparrows now seem to be declining across most of their range.Back to top"

In parts of Asia where wooded habitats are more limited (such as western China, Mongolia, and Siberia), Great Tits occur in birch and willow thickets along rivers, in isolated clusters of trees, and in villages.Back to top",
      "food": "Great Tits feed largely on insects, including adults, pupae, larvae, and eggs. Favored insect groups include moths, butterflies, beetles, bugs, flies, wasps, bees, and ants, but Great Tits eat other types of insects, and spiders, depending on availability. During the winter, seeds—especially from beech and hazel trees—and fruits become important food sources alongside insects. Great Tits are also regular visitors to bird feeders.Great Tits forage in trees by hopping along small branches, probing bark for insects, and hanging upside down when needed. They also hop on the ground, looking for invertebrates or fallen seeds from trees. After finding food, birds usually fly to a perch, hold the item with one foot (insects) or two feet (seeds), and peck at it.Back to top",

They are also smart, quickly learning to take advantage of unique feeding opportunities. In a British study, these tits displayed spontaneous problem-solving skills—pulling levers and strings—to get food from a bird feeder puzzle. Great Tits are one of a small number of avian tool-users, with birds observed using a conifer needle to pull insect larvae out of a hole in a tree.Great Tits are monogamous within a breeding season, but in areas where they form winter foraging flocks, pairs split up after the breeding season and then usually pair up again with the same partner for the next breeding season. The female builds the nest and is responsible for all incubation and brooding. Clutch size ranges from 3 to 18 eggs; first clutches in Europe generally average 9–11 eggs, while second clutches typically have two fewer eggs. Both sexes feed the nestlings, which leave the nest after a little less than three weeks. Outside of the breeding season, this species is social, with up to 50 Great Tits at a time forming mixed-species flocks with other small songbirds.Back to top",

Pair bonding involves “moth display flights” with shallow, rapid wingbeats; “butterfly display flights” with deep, slow wingbeats; “high display flights” that involve flying as high as 6 meters (20 feet) and then diving back down; and “dance displays” in which males hop about near the nest cavity while showcasing their rich blue crown, wings, and tail. Some males are polygamous, mating with more than one female. These females all nest within the male’s territory, and he attends to each of their nests. The female builds the nest and is responsible for all incubation and brooding. Both sexes feed the nestlings, which typically leave the nest after about three weeks.Back to top",

Mainly ground foragers, they peck at grain and seeds scattered beneath backyard feeders and on feeding platforms, or spilled at farmyards. Flocks of 10 to several hundred doves may gather at prime spots. Although they can feed peacefully in mixed flocks, Eurasian Collared-Doves will also chase off other birds, including Mourning Doves, cardinals, and Blue Jays. The male advertises for a mate with an insistentkoo-KOO-kookcall from a high perch, repeating the call up to a dozen times in a bout, sometimes starting before dawn and continuing into the night. Calls are followed by a flight display in which the male flies steeply upward, clapping his wings, then descends with tail spread, often spiraling down to the same or a nearby perch. Once a pair has formed, males show females potential nest sites, usually in tall trees but occasionally on buildings. In between these “site visits” the pair vigorously preen each other. Male doves bring females sticks and other material for the simple nest, and aggressively chase away other collared-doves, as well as predators—venture too close and you risk getting hit by a flapping wing. The monogamous pair may raise up to six broods a year; the female can lay a new clutch while young are still in a previous nest.Back to top",

Both intentional and accidental introductions in North America have likely hastened the species' spread. Studies on interactions between collared-doves and other species have not yet shown a negative impact on populations of native birds, including Mourning Doves.

This species occurs in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, as well as other habitats, but it generally avoids dense forest, large wetlands, and treeless areas.Back to top",
      "food": "Eurasian Magpies are omnivores and opportunistic feeders. In many situations, insects—and in particular, beetles—are their main food source. They also take advantage of fruits, seeds, carrion, refuse, and other plentiful foods. Eurasian Magpies are also notorious for raiding the nests of other birds and feeding on eggs and chicks, but vertebrates typically make up a small percentage of their overall diet.Eurasian Magpies usually forage on the ground. They walk slowly—often with long tail raised—in search of prey, then stop to survey the area before hopping or walking quickly to pick an item from the ground. They sometimes cache food—a behavior shared with many other members of the crow, jay, and magpie family—but the stored food is usually perishable, so they typically reclaim it within a week or two.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Eurasian Magpies’ behavior makes them very conspicuous and familiar birds. They often perch high up in trees or on rooftops, where they sound the alarm against cats, foxes, owls, raptors, and other predators. Unlike most crows and jays, they usually fly low to the ground. Their flight appears labored—a series of rapid wingbeats followed by glides, all while seeming to drag along their long tail. On the ground, magpies walk assuredly, often with their tail up, and intersperse strong hops and jumps.Eurasian Magpie pairs are monogamous, maintaining pair bonds throughout the year for several years. Both sexes contribute to nest building—the male gathers most of the materials and the female does most of the actual construction. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young chicks. Both parents feed the nestlings and fledglings for about six weeks after they leave the nest. Like other crows, jays, and magpies, Eurasian Magpies often travel as families and at times gather in large groups of 20+ birds at communal roosts.Back to top",

Preferred sites include eaves, rafters, and cross beams of barns, sheds and stables, as well as the undersides of bridges, wharfs, and culverts. They may also use nests from previous years, but avoid those infested heavily with mites or other parasites.",
      "conservation": "Barn Swallow populations declined by close to 0.6% per year from 1966 to 2019, resulting in an estimated cumulative decline of 25%, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 190 million and rates them 8 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Barn Swallows were hunted for the hat trade in the nineteenth century and are still hunted for food in parts of their wintering range. Discarded twine or fishing line can pose a problem when Barn Swallows use these materials to line their nests, because the strands can entangle adults or young and trap them. On a more positive note, this species has benefited from human-made structures, and people generally encourage these attractive, insect-eating birds to nest near them. As a result, Barn Swallows have greatly expanded their breeding range and numbers as people have settled the continent.Back to top"

L'espèce est divisée en un certain nombre de sous-espèces, dont certaines sont désormais considérées comme des espèces à part entière. La femelle construit un nid en forme de dôme sur ou près du sol, et assume l'essentiel de la couvaison et de l'alimentation des oisillons, tandis que le mâle a peu d'implication dans la nidification, mais défend son territoire contre ses rivaux, et attaque les prédateurs potentiels.",

These distinctive songbirds spend much of their time in groups. They form noisy foraging flocks by day, keep warm on cold nights by huddling along a tree branch, and even help their relatives raise young. Long-tailed Tits occur in almost any habitat with trees or shrubs, including woodlands, gardens, and parks, but they typically don’t stick around for long—these restless birds are constantly on the move in search of caterpillars and other insects.",

Found largely in Asia, all 11 species have a penchant for cooperative breeding and building large, enclosed nests. Long-tailed Tit is the only member of this family found in Europe, while Bushtit is the only one occurring in the Americas.",
      "Long-tailed Tits are cooperative breeders, with some nesting pairs assisted by anywhere from one to eight helpers. These helpers, who are typically failed breeders related to the nesting male, help feed the young birds and their efforts usually increase breeding success.",
      "Long-tailed Tits take their nest decorating very seriously. A nesting pair might add up to 3,000 lichen pieces to the outside of the nest and line the inside with 1,500 or more small feathers. The lichen helps camouflage the nest, while the feathers help to insulate it."

      "habitat": "Long-tailed Tits are birds of woodlands, scrubby areas, gardens, parks, and farmland hedgerows—essentially any place with trees or bushes. Nesting birds are most successful in bushes and hedgerows outside of woodlands. During the winter and early spring, Long-tailed Tit flocks often roam deciduous woodlands, focusing on different tree species (oak, ash, and sycamore) as spring progresses. While they do spend time in backyards and gardens, Long-tailed Tits are often just passing through—they are less likely to approach homes and visit bird feeders than Great Tit, Eurasian Blue Tit, and Coal Tit.Back to top",
      "food": "Long-tailed Tits feed primarily on insects and spiders, with bugs (Hemiptera), caterpillars, and moth/butterfly eggs often favored items. They explore tree canopies and the tops of bushes for food, hopping along branches, hanging upside-down from twigs, and switching trees every few minutes. They sometimes join Eurasian Blue Tits (and other tits) in mixed-species flocks, but unlike that species, Long-tailed Tits rarely forage on the ground.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Long-tailed Tits are noisy, restless, and social birds. They call frequently, and often flick their wings and tail. In the winter, they form family-based foraging flocks that range in size from 3 to 30 birds. At night, these winter flocks roost communally to stay warm, with birds packed tightly together, side by side, along a horizontal branch. Winter flocks are territorial, but multiple flocks sometimes join together to form large groups that can reach 300 individuals.With their round bodies and extremely long tails, Long-tailed Tits have a distinctive “blob and line” flight silhouette. Their rapid wingbeats create a whirring sound, but at times these tits appear to struggle to stay aloft. When a Long-tailed Tit foraging flock reaches an opening in the vegetation, the birds call excitedly and “follow the leader”: a lead bird crosses the clearing, followed by another, and then another, until one at a time, all the birds make the crossing.Long-tailed Tits form monogamous pairs, but cooperative breeding, in which helpers assist breeding pairs, is common. These helpers are typically related to the nesting male and have failed in their own nesting efforts for the breeding season. Both sexes build the elaborately domed nest in about 2–4 weeks. The female is responsible for all incubation and most brooding. Both sexes, plus any helpers at the nest, feed the nestlings and fledglings.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Long-tailed Tits typically build their nests less than 3 meters (10 feet) off the ground, but some birds nest in treetops up to 35 meters (115 feet) high. Nests are built within thorny bushes or placed on tree forks or against trunks.",
      "conservation": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists Long-tailed Tit’s conservation status asLeast Concerndue to an extremely large range, stable population trend, and extremely large population size (estimated at 40–80 million individuals).Back to top"

Eurasian Jackdaws are agile and accomplished fliers, taking advantage of winds and updrafts to soar and perform impressive group acrobatics.Jackdaws usually begin breeding when they are two years old. Pairs form lifelong bonds, remain together year-round, and, when joining flocks, stay closer to each other than to other flock members. Both sexes build the nest, which is sometimes built on top of nests from previous years. The female incubates the eggs, and then both adults feed the chicks. Young birds typically leave the nest after about five weeks and remain with their parents and siblings in a family group for about a month after fledging.Back to top",

    "description": "The Golden Eagle is one of the largest, fastest, nimblest raptors in North America. Lustrous gold feathers gleam on the back of its head and neck; a powerful beak and talons advertise its hunting prowess. You're most likely to see this eagle in western North America, soaring on steady wings or diving in pursuit of the jackrabbits and other small mammals that are its main prey. Sometimes seen attacking large mammals, or fighting off coyotes or bears in defense of its prey and young, the Golden Eagle has long inspired both reverence and fear.",
    "cool_facts": [
      "Although capable of killing large prey such as cranes, wild ungulates, and domestic livestock, the Golden Eagle subsists primarily on rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, and prairie dogs.",
      "The amount of white in the wings of a young Golden Eagle varies among individuals, and a few lack white in the wings entirely.",
      "The Golden Eagle is the most common official national animal in the world—it's the emblem of Albania, Germany, Austria, Mexico, and Kazakhstan.",
      "Because their common prey animals (mammals) don’t tend to ingest pesticides, Golden Eagles have escaped the harm sustained by fish-eating or bird-eating raptors from DDT and related chemicals. When these pesticides thinned the eggshells of many birds of prey, Golden Eagles’ shells retained normal thickness. Pesticide concentrations in their blood stayed below levels known to cause reproductive problems.",
      "Biologists, engineers, and government officials have cooperated in developing and publicizing power-pole designs that reduce raptor electrocutions—caused when the large birds' wings or feet accidentally touch two lines and form a circuit. Since the early 1970s, utility companies have modified poles to prevent eagle electrocutions. And some new power lines in nonurban areas have been built to “raptor-safe” construction standards.",
      "“Hacking,” an age-old falconry technique, is helping rebuild Golden Eagle populations. Humans feed caged, lab-reared nestlings at a nestlike hack site until the birds reach 12 weeks old, when the cage is opened and they begin feeding themselves. The fledglings continue to receive handouts from their hack-site caretakers for several weeks, until they gain full independence in the wild.",
      "The Rough-legged Hawk, the Ferruginous Hawk, and the Golden Eagle are the only American raptors to have legs feathered all the way to the toes.",
      "The oldest recorded Golden Eagle was at least 31 years, 8 months old, when it was found in 2012 in Utah. It was banded in the same state in 1980."

They are found primarily in mountains up to 12,000 feet, canyonlands, rimrock terrain, and riverside cliffs and bluffs. Golden Eagles nest on cliffs and steep escarpments in grassland, chapparal, shrubland, forest, and other vegetated areas.Back to top",
      "food": "Golden Eagles prey mainly on small to medium-sized mammals, including hares, rabbits, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and marmots. Black-tailed jackrabbits are a key prey species throughout much of their range. These eagles are also capable of taking larger bird and mammal prey, including cranes, swans, deer, and domestic livestock. They have even been observed killing seals, mountain goats, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, coyotes, badgers, and bobcats. In addition to live prey, Golden Eagles often feed on carrion, following crows and other scavengers to a meal. They also catch fish, rob nests, and steal food from other birds.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Golden Eagles possess astonishing speed and maneuverability for their size. Diving from great heights, they have been clocked at close to 200 miles per hour. In an undulating territorial and courtship display known as “sky-dancing,” a Golden Eagle performs a rapid series of up to 20 steep dives and upward swoops, beating its wings three or four times at the top of each rise. In “pendulum flight,” the eagle dives and rises, then turns over to retrace its path. Single birds and pairs engage in aerial play with objects such as sticks or dead prey, carrying these items high into the sky, then dropping and retrieving them. In addition to attacking prey from the air, Golden Eagles sometimes hunt on the ground, wildly flapping as they run. Mated pairs hunt jackrabbits cooperatively during breeding season—one eagle diverting the animal’s attention while the second makes the kill.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Golden Eagles usually nest on cliffs. They may also build nests in trees, on the ground, or in human-made structures, including windmills, observation towers, nesting platforms, and electrical transmission towers. Constructed near hunting grounds, Golden Eagle nests often command a wide view of their surroundings.",
      "conservation": "Golden Eagle populations were stable between 1966 and 2019, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates their global breeding population to be 130,000 and rates them 10 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. In 1962, theU.S. Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Actoutlawed harming these birds, their eggs, and their nests. Although this legislation remains in effect, humans are still Golden Eagles’ greatest threat. It's estimated that more than 70% of recorded Golden Eagle deaths are attributable to human impact, either intentional or inadvertent. Some sheep ranchers trapped, shot, or poisoned the birds into the 1980s. Some eagles die after eating poisoned prey animals set out to control coyotes. Others succumb to lead poisoning from ammunition in hunter-shot prey. Most recorded deaths are from collisions with vehicles, wind turbines, and other structures or from electrocution at power poles (newer designs have been developed that, if used, can greatly reduce this risk). Urbanization, agricultural development, and changes in wildfire regimes have compromised nesting and hunting grounds in southern California and in the sagebrush steppes of the inner western U.S. Golden Eagles did not prove as susceptible to poisoning from the pesticide DDT as other large raptors, probably because of their diet of mammals.Back to top"

    "description": "The American Goshawk is the bigger, fiercer, wilder relative of the Sharp-shinned and Cooper’s Hawks that prowl suburbs and backyards. It’s an accipiter—a type of hawk with short, broad wings and a long rudderlike tail that give it superb aerial agility. These secretive birds are mostly gray as adults, with bold white “eyebrow” stripes over piercing orange to red eyes. American Goshawks flash through forests chasing bird and mammal prey, pouncing silently or crashing feet first through brush to grab quarry in crushingly strong talons.",
    "cool_facts": [
      "The name goshawk comes from the Old English word for “goose hawk,” a reference to this raptor’s habit of preying on birds. Falconers have trained goshawks for more than 2,000 years; the birds were once called “cook’s hawk” for their success at snaring meat for the pot.",
      "Like all accipiters, American Goshawks display “reversed sexual size dimorphism”—females are up to 25% heavier than males. The size difference means that between them, pair members can feed on a wider range of prey. When nesting, the larger female warms the eggs while the male is responsible for bringing food.",
      "In 2023, the American Ornithological Society split Northern Goshawk, which occurred in North America and Eurasia, into two species: American Goshawk and Eurasian Goshawk. These “new” species area return to how ornithologists treated North American and Eurasian goshawk populationsup to the middle of the 20th century.",
      "American Goshawk pairs build and maintain up to eight alternate nests within their nesting area. Even with options available, they may use the same nest year after year, or may switch to a new nest after a brood fails. Pairs may add fresh conifer needles to the nest during breeding. Aromatic chemicals (terpenes) in the needles may act as a natural insecticide and fungicide.",
      "The American Goshawk is well known for its fierce defense of its nest. It commonly attacks people and other animals that approach the nest too closely.",
      "The oldest known American Goshawk was at least 17 years, 7 months old when it was found in Michigan in 2013. It had been banded in 1995, also in Michigan."

      "habitat": "Throughout their range, whether at sea level or in alpine settings, American Goshawks nest in mature and old-growth forests with more than 60% closed canopy. In the East, goshawks seek out nest sites in mixed-hardwood forests where beeches, birch, hemlock, and maples dominate. In South Dakota and the Southwest, they nest in ponderosa pine forests. Farther west, breeding sites include Douglas-fir and pine forests, aspen groves, and stands of paper birch (in Alaska). Goshawks often build nests near breaks in the canopy, such as a forest trail, jeep road, or opening created by a downed tree, and prefer sites with a creek, pond, or lake nearby. Goshawks hunt in the forest, along riparian corridors, and in more open habitat, such as the sagebrush steppes of Nevada, where their broad, powerful wings can quickly generate speed to ambush prey.Back to top",
      "food": "American Goshawks eat a wider range of prey than other accipiters, including birds, mammals, and reptiles, as well as insects and occasionally carrion. Tree and ground squirrels, snowshoe hares, jackrabbits, and cottontails are the main mammal prey. Goshawks also eat large birds such as Dusky, Sooty, Spruce, and Ruffed Grouse, along with Pileated, Black-backed, American Three-toed, and Hairy Woodpeckers, Northern Flickers, Williamson’s Sapsuckers, and corvids including Blue Jays, Canada Jays, Steller’s Jays, and crows. Look for piles of feathers on the forest floor that may indicate a low “plucking perch” near a goshawk nest.Back to top",
      "behavior": "American Goshawks alternate short flights with brief stops at elevated perches as they search for birds and small mammals in the forest, and cruise along forest edges or over shrub habitat seeking prey. They glide quickly and silently, striking unwary quarry feet first. If detected, these reckless hunters fly at high speeds in pursuit of fleeing prey, maneuvering through the forest using their long tail as a rudder, crashing through brush and even chasing a potential meal into the water if necessary. American Goshawks also occasionally stalk prey on foot. They can capture mammals such as snowshoe hares more than twice their weight. Breeding pairs perform a sky dance as part of their courtship, with the male diving at the female high above the forest canopy or chasing her through the trees. Pairs often then fly together in an undulating glide above the trees—one of the few times they are relatively easy to spot. Breeding pairs copulate quickly and often (sometimes more than 500 times per clutch), with frequency peaking 30-40 days prior to laying eggs and again just before and during egg laying. Once the chicks hatch, males provide the bulk of the food while females guard the nest site. Although otherwise secretive, American Goshawks can be fierce and vocal when defending their nestlings, and will attack human intruders and kill neighboring raptors they perceive as threats, including owls and hawks.Back to top",
      "nesting": "American Goshawks usually choose the largest trees in a stand for nest sites, placing the nest next to the trunk on a large horizontal branch or in a primary or secondary crotch. In the East and Midwest, goshawks choose beech, maple, oak, and aspen trees for their nests. Western birds build nests in conifers, such as Douglas-fir, white fir, California red fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, and western hemlock, along with deciduous trees including aspens and paper birch.",
      "conservation": "American Goshawks are widespread but uncommon, and their secretive nature makes it hard to estimate population trends. The North American Breeding Bird Survey indicates populations on the continent held steady between 1966 and 2021. Before the taxonomic split in 2023, Partners in Flight estimated the global breeding population of Northern Goshawk (which included American and Eurasian Goshawks) at 420,000 and rated the species a 10 out of 20 on their Continental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Goshawks were once shot and trapped because they were seen as a threat to domestic poultry. In the 1930s, Pennsylvania and other states paid hunters a $5 bounty for each goshawk they killed. An amendment to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act extended protection to raptors in 1972. Today, timber harvest is the main threat to breeding goshawks, which depend on mature trees and forests with relatively intact canopies for nesting and foraging. Goshawks appear to favor larger tracts of forests. Nesting birds are sensitive to logging activities such as building roads and loading and skidding felled trees. The U.S. Forest Service includes the goshawk on its “Sensitive Species” list for many regions; this requires that proposed management activities, such as logging, consider potential impacts on goshawks. Falconers have trained goshawks as hunting partners for more than 2,000 years. State and federal rules regulate the number of wild goshawks taken for falconry through a strict permit process. The impact of falconry on wild North American goshawk populations is thought to be minimal.Back to top"

They can be found nesting at elevations up to about 12,000 feet, as well as along rivers and coastlines or in cities, where the local Rock Pigeon populations offer a reliable food supply. In migration and winter you can find Peregrine Falcons in nearly any open habitat, but with a greater likelihood along barrier islands, mudflats, coastlines, lake edges, and mountain chains.Back to top",
      "food": "Peregrine Falcons eat mostly birds, of an enormous variety—450 North American species have been documented as prey, and the number worldwide may be as many as 2,000 species. They have been observed killing birds as large as a Sandhill Crane, as small as a hummingbird, and as elusive as a White-throated Swift. Typical prey include shorebirds, ptarmigan, ducks, grebes, gulls, storm-petrels, pigeons, and songbirds including jays, thrushes, longspurs, buntings, larks, waxwings, and starlings. Peregrine Falcons also eat substantial numbers of bats. They occasionally pirate prey, including fish and rodents, from other raptors.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Peregrine Falcons are very strong fliers and often reported to be the fastest bird in the world. Their average cruising flight speed is 24 to 33 mph, increasing to 67 mph when in pursuit of prey. When stooping, or dropping on prey with their wings closed, it's been calculated that Peregrine Falcons can achieve speeds of 238 mph. One researcher studied trained Peregrine Falcons while skydiving and described their body position while diving at 150 mph and 200 mph. When hunting, Peregrines start by watching from a high perch or by flapping slowly or soaring at great height. Stoops begin 300–3,000 feet above their prey and end either by grabbing the prey or by striking it with the feet hard enough to stun or kill it. They then catch the bird and bite through the neck to kill it. Peregrine Falcons do have other hunting methods, including level pursuit, picking birds out of large flocks, and occasionally even hunting on the ground. Though the Peregrine Falcon is an elite predator, it does have its own predators, including Gyrfalcons, eagles, Great Horned owls, and other Peregrines.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Typically, Peregrine Falcons nest on cliffs from about 25–1,300 feet high (and higher, including on the rim of the Grand Canyon). On these cliffs they choose a ledge that is typically around a third of the way down the cliff face. Other sites include electricity transmission towers, quarries, silos, skyscrapers, churches, and bridges. In places without cliffs, Peregrines may use abandoned Common Raven, Bald Eagle, Osprey, Red-tailed Hawk, or cormorant nests. In the Pacific Northwest they may nest among or under Sitka spruce tree roots on steep slopes. Peregrine Falcons sometimes useartificial nest boxesplaced on tall buildings.",
      "conservation": "The Peregrine Falcon has been recovering slowly after populations crashed from 1950-1970 because of DDT poisoning. During this time, the eastern population was extirpated, and it was declared an Endangered Species. Since 1966, populations appear to have stabilized according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates the global breeding population to be 340,000 and now rates this species a 9 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. The Peregrine Falcon's remarkable recovery is due to pesticide bans and extensive efforts that were made to reestablish birds in the East, beginning with the work of Tom Cade in 1970 at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which eventually developed intoThe Peregrine Fund. The species recovered enough to be removed from the Endangered Species List in 1999.Back to top"

The boreal subspecies usually nests near forested openings, in fragmented woodlots, near rivers, lakes, or bogs, and on lake islands. The Pacific Northwest subspecies seems to nest mostly in coastal areas and along rivers. The prairie subspecies nests in shrubs and trees along rivers and in small groves of deciduous trees planted as wind breaks. Merlins are increasingly breeding in towns and cities, where they often take over crow nests in conifers planted in residential areas, schoolyards, parks, and cemeteries. During migration Merlins stop in grasslands, open forests, and coastal areas. They winter in similar habitat across the western United States and southern United States, along the Pacific coast to Alaska, and along the Atlantic coast to southern New England. Their wintering range extends south through Latin America as far as Ecuador.Back to top",

They often specialize on hunting a couple of the most abundant species around; prey are generally small to medium-sized birds in the 1–2 ounce range. Common prey include Horned Lark, House Sparrow, Bohemian Waxwing, Dickcissel, Least Sandpiper, Dunlin, and other shorebirds. They don’t stoop on birds the way Peregrine Falcons do; instead they attack at high speed, horizontally or even from below, chasing the prey upwards until they tire. Other prey include large insects such as dragonflies, bats caught at cave openings, nestling birds, and small mammals. Merlin pairs have been seen teaming up to hunt large flocks of waxwings: one Merlin flushes the flock by attacking from below; the other comes in moments later to take advantage of the confusion.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Like other falcons, the Merlin is a strong and maneuverable flier. A typical flight speed is 30 miles per hour, and can be faster during chases. Despite their small size, Merlins look powerful in flight; they flap their wings faster than Prairie or Peregrine falcons. During the breeding season they are highly territorial around the nest, chasing away other Merlins and potential predators. Merlins are monogamous during a breeding season, but 80 percent find new mates from year to year. When courting, Merlins (particularly males) perform spectacular flight displays, including bursts of strong, level flight while rocking side to side in the air; deep U-shaped dives; and slow, fluttering flights in a circle or figure-eight near to a perched mate. Both sexes claim their territory by soaring high in the air near their nest. Males also make a slow landing next to their mate, keeping their legs outstretched, bowing the head, and fanning the tail; he may bring food for the female. Outside of the breeding season, Merlins are usually solitary. However, they sometimes migrate in loose groups, roost communally, or spend the winter in pairs. Adults may be preyed on by Peregrine Falcons, Great Horned Owls, Cooper’s Hawks, and Red-tailed Hawks.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Merlins lay their eggs in abandoned nests of crows and hawks, in either conifers or deciduous trees of semiopen habitats. They tend to choose nests with a good view of the surrounding area. On rare occasions they nest in tree cavities, on cliffs, or on the ground.",
      "conservation": "Merlin populations increased nearly 2% per year between 1966 and 2019, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. This increase reflects their recovery from widespread declines in the 1960s due to pesticide contamination.Partners in Flightestimates the global breeding population at 3.2 million and rates them 7 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Starting in the late twentieth century, breeding Merlins have been colonizing an increasing number of cities and towns, where they take advantage of abundant House Sparrows for food and old crow nests for breeding sites. In 1995, they started expanding into New York and northern New England and now breed across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Their winter range spread into the northern Great Plains between 1960 and 1990. Their ability to colonize urban areas may be counteracting a decline in other parts of their breeding and wintering ranges from habitat loss.Back to top"

    "description": "Unique among North American raptors for its diet of live fish and ability to dive into water to catch them, Ospreys are common sights soaring over shorelines, patrolling waterways, and standing on their huge stick nests, white heads gleaming. These large, rangy hawks do well around humans and have rebounded in numbers following the ban on the pesticide DDT. Hunting Ospreys are a picture of concentration, diving with feet outstretched and yellow eyes sighting straight along their talons.",
    "cool_facts": [
      "An Osprey may log more than 160,000 migration miles during its 15-to-20-year lifetime. Scientists track Ospreys by strapping lightweight satellite transmitters to the birds’ backs. The devices pinpoint an Osprey's location to within a few hundred yards and last for 2-3 years. During 13 days in 2008,one Osprey flew 2,700 miles—from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, to French Guiana, South America.",
      "Ospreys are unusual among hawks in possessing a reversible outer toe that allows them to grasp with two toes in front and two behind. Barbed pads on the soles of the birds' feet help them grip slippery fish. When flying with prey, an Osprey lines up its catch head first for less wind resistance.",
      "Ospreys are excellent anglers. Over several studies, Ospreys caught fish on at least 1 in every 4 dives, with success rates sometimes as high as 70 percent. The average time they spent hunting before making a catch was about 12 minutes—something to think about next time you throw your line in the water.",
      "The Osprey readily builds its nest on manmade structures, such as telephone poles, channel markers, duck blinds, and nest platforms designed especially for it. Such platforms have become an important tool in reestablishing Ospreys in areas where they had disappeared. In some areas nests are placed almost exclusively on artificial structures.",
      "Osprey eggs do not hatch all at once. Rather, the first chick emerges up to five days before the last one. The older hatchling dominates its younger siblings, and can monopolize the food brought by the parents. If food is abundant, chicks share meals in relative harmony; in times of scarcity, younger ones may starve to death.",
      "The name \"Osprey\" made its first appearance around 1460, via the Medieval Latin phrase for \"bird of prey\" (avis prede). Some wordsmiths trace the name even further back, to the Latin for \"bone-breaker\"—ossifragus.",
      "The oldest known Osprey was at least 25 years, 2 months old, and lived in Virginia. It was banded in 1973, and found in 1998."

      "habitat": "Unable to dive to more than about three feet below the water's surface, Ospreys gravitate toward shallow fishing grounds, frequenting deep water only where fish school near the surface. Ospreys nest in a wide variety of locations, from Alaska to New England, Montana to Mexico, Carolina to California; their habitat includes almost any expanse of shallow, fish-filled water, including rivers, lakes, reservoirs, lagoons, swamps, and marshes. Whatever the location, Osprey nesting habitat must include an adequate supply of accessible fish within a maximum of about 12 miles of the nest; open, usually elevated nest sites free from predatory mammals such as raccoons, and a long enough ice-free season to allow the young to fledge.Back to top",
      "food": "The Osprey is the only hawk on the continent that eats almost exclusively live fish. In North America, more than 80 species of live fresh- and saltwater fish account for 99 percent of the Osprey’s diet. Captured fish usually measure about 6–13 inches in length and weigh one-third to two-thirds of a pound. The largest catch on record weighed about 2.5 pounds. On very rare occasions, Ospreys have been observed feeding on fish carcasses or on birds, snakes, voles, squirrels, muskrats, and salamanders.  Ospreys probably get most of the water they need from the flesh of their prey, although there are reports of adults drinking on hot days.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Adept at soaring and diving but not as maneuverable as other hawks, Ospreys keep to open areas, flying with stiff wingbeats in a steady, rowing motion. Primarily solitary birds, they usually roost alone or in small winter flocks of six to ten. Nesting Ospreys defend only the immediate area around their nest rather than a larger territory; they vigorously chase other Ospreys that encroach on their nesting areas. In breeding season, males perform an aerial \"sky-dance,\" sometimes called \"fish-flight.\" With dangling legs, often clasping a fish or nesting material in his talons, the male alternates periods of hovering with slow, shallow swoops as high as 600 feet or more above the nest site. Sustaining this display for 10 minutes or more, he utters repeated screaming calls while gradually descending in an undulating fashion to the nest.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Ospreys require nest sites in open surroundings for easy approach, with a wide, sturdy base and safety from ground predators (such as raccoons). Nests are usually built on snags, treetops, or crotches between large branches and trunks; on cliffs or human-built platforms. Usually the male finds the site before the female arrives.",
      "conservation": "Ospreys are a conservation success story, and their numbers grew by approximately 1.9% per year from 1966 to 2019, according to theNorth American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates a global breeding population of 1.2 million and rates them 7 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Osprey numbers crashed in the early 1950s to 1970s, when pesticides poisoned the birds and thinned their eggshells. Along the coast between New York City and Boston, for example, about 90% of breeding pairs disappeared. Osprey studies provided key support for wider legal arguments against the use of persistent pesticides. After the 1972 U.S. DDT ban, populations rebounded, and the Osprey became a conservation success symbol. Ospreys are still listed as endangered or threatened in some states—especially inland, where pesticides decimated or extirpated many populations. As natural nest sites have succumbed to tree removal and shoreline development, specially constructed nest platforms and other structures, such as channel markers and utility poles, have become vital to the Osprey’s recovery. Sadly, a growing cause of death for Ospreys is entanglement at the nest. Adults incorporate baling twine and other discarded plastic lines into their nests, and these can wrap around a chick's feet and injure it or keep it from leaving the nest.Back to top"

The pellets make a great record of what the owls have eaten, and scientists study them to learn more about the owls and the ecosystems they live in.",
      "Barn owls have excellent low-light vision, and can easily find prey at night by sight. But their ability to locate prey by sound alone is the best of any animal that has ever been tested. They can catch mice in complete darkness in the lab, or hidden by vegetation or snow out in the real world.",

      "food": "American Barn Owls eat mostly small mammals, particularly rats, mice, voles, lemmings, and other rodents; also shrews, bats, and rabbits. Most of the prey they eat are active at night, so squirrels and chipmunks are relatively safe from these owls. They occasionally eat birds such as starlings, blackbirds, and meadowlarks. Nesting American Barn Owls sometimes store dozens of prey items at the nest site while they are incubating to feed the young once they hatch.Back to top",
      "behavior": "American Barn Owls fly slowly over open fields at night or dusk with slow wingbeats and a looping, buoyant flight. They use their impressive hearing, aided by their satellite-dish-shaped faces, to locate mice and other rodents in the grass, often in complete darkness. These owls are usually monogamous and mate for life, although there are some reports of males with more than one mate. Males attract their mates with several kinds of display flights, including a “moth flight” where he hovers in front of a female for several seconds, his feet dangling. He also displays potential nest sites by calling and flying in and out of the nest. After the pair forms, the male brings prey to the female (often more than she can consume), beginning about a month before she starts laying eggs. American Barn Owls defend the area around their nests, but don’t defend their hunting sites; more than one pair may hunt on the same fields.Back to top",
      "nesting": "American Barn Owls put their nests in holes in trees, cliff ledges and crevices, caves, burrows in river banks, and in many kinds of human structures, including barn lofts, church steeples, houses, nest boxes, haystacks, and even drive-in movie screens.",
      "conservation": "American Barn Owls are difficult to count because they're nocturnal and secretive, so population sizes are hard to estimate. Owing in part to this difficulty, the North American Breeding Bird Survey could not detect a significant population change between 1966 and 2021, although it appears that their numbers have slightly increased in that time. Prior to the taxonomic split in 2024,Partners in Flightestimated a global breeding population of 3.6 million for Barn Owl (which included American Barn Owl, Eastern Barn Owl, and Western Barn Owl) and rated the species an 8 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. American Barn Owls are threatened by the conversion of agricultural land to urban and suburban development, and the loss of suitable nesting sites such as large, hollow trees and old buildings. Changes to agricultural fields and grasslands can also affect American Barn Owls through changes to their prey populations. American Barn Owls were affected by the use of DDT-related pesticides, and they may be susceptible to poisons used against rodents, since they form a large part of the owls’ diet. Because American Barn Owls hunt by flying low over fields, they are often hit by cars; planting hedgerows alongside roads can help prevent this from happening. Nest boxes (of the correct size) have helped American Barn Owl populations recover in areas where natural nest sites were scarce.Back to top"

      "habitat": "Boreal Owls occur in stands of spruce, aspen, poplar, birch, and fir in the vast boreal forest that stretches across much of northern North America and Eurasia. They also occur in high elevation mountains with subalpine forests in Canada and the western U.S. In the winter, they forage in spruce-fir forests where uncrusted snow under the trees facilitates access to prey. In spring, they often forage in clearcuts and agricultural fields where small mammals are easier to locate.Back to top",
      "food": "Boreal Owls eat small mammals, birds, and insects. Small mammals in their diet include voles, mice, shrews, and squirrels. They hunt at night, except in the far north where the sun doesn't set in the summer. From hunting perches, they sit and wait for prey before attacking it with their talons. Like other owls, they cough up pellets of indigestible bones and fur, usually once a day.Back to top",
      "behavior": "When attacking prey, Boreal Owls glide down to the ground and grab it with their talons. Boreal Owls are solitary birds, even during the breeding season. Mated pairs don't roost together and typically only meet up at the nest site during courtship and feeding. The male courts the female with song and food, feeding her for up to 3 months prior to nesting. He continues to bring food to the female throughout the nesting period. Males and females form monogamous bonds in North America for a single breeding season. In Europe males sometimes mate with more than one female and can produce more than one brood per season, unlike the single-brooded pairs in North America. Males sing to maintain their territory, but they only defend the area surrounding the nest cavity, not the entire foraging territory.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Boreal Owls nest in older stands of mixed-conifer forests, but also in nest boxes in younger forests. The male advertises 1–5 nest sites within his territory, from which the female chooses.",
      "conservation": "Boreal Owls are uncommon and infrequently encountered. Their boreal range and nocturnal habits mean that their populations are not surveyed by the North American Breeding Bird Survey and little is known about population trends.Partners in Flightestimates the global breeding population at 1.7 million. The species rates a 10 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, which means it is not on thePartners in Flight Watch Listand is a species of low conservation concern.Back to top"

These nocturnal hunters roost in dense foliage, where their camouflage makes them hard to find, and forage over grasslands for small mammals. Long-eared Owls are nimble flyers, with hearing so acute they can snatch prey in complete darkness. In spring and summer, listen for their low, breathy hoots and strange barking calls in the night.",

      "The hoot of the male Long-eared Owl can sometimes be heard up to 1 kilometer (0.7 mi) away.",
      "Like other owls, the Long-eared has a body adapted for silent flight and precision hunting. Flight feathers with fringed edges and downy surfaces mute the sound of the owl’s passage through air. The owls gain incredible hearing from their asymmetrically placed ear openings and large, sound-catching facial disks.",
      "In 1994, a researcher discovered a nesting Cooper’s Hawk incubating two Long-eared Owl eggs along with three of its own. The hawk had probably usurped the nest from the owl. Another researcher documented three cases of Long-eared Owls appropriating nests that had been recently built by American Crows.",
      "Long-eared Owls swallow their prey whole and then regurgitate the indigestible parts in pellets, usually one per day. If you find these pellets they’re fascinating to pick through, full of tiny animal bones and fur. Some biologists collect these pellets and use them to learn about owl diets.",
      "In addition to the North American and Eurasian populations, isolated groups of Long-eared Owls occur in North and East Africa, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. While this owl’s biology has been extensively studied in the U.S. and Europe, little is known about it in other parts of its range.",
      "The oldest Long-eared Owl on record was at least 12 years, 1 month old. It was originally banded in New York and was later found in Ontario, Canada, in 1999."

In Idaho, large numbers of Long-eared Owls nest in willows, cottonwoods, and junipers adjacent to shrubsteppe; in several western states these owls also often build their nests in brushy vegetation adjacent to open habitats. In some areas, including in Michigan and western Oregon, Long-eared owl nests are found in coniferous or deciduous forests near open meadows.Back to top",

They hunt over open ground or below the canopy in sparsely forested areas. Prey items usually weigh up to about 3.5 ounces, often less than 2 ounces. They also sometimes eat small birds, capturing them on the ground or (in the case of roosting birds) from low vegetation. Rarely, Long-eared Owls eat moles, bats, weasels, chipmunks, ground and tree squirrels, snakes, and lizards.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Long-eared Owls hunt on the wing, coursing back and forth low above open ground. They may also hover over prey, or hunt from perches in strong winds. They kill small mammals with a bite to the back of the skull, and often swallow their prey whole. Nesting Long-eared Owls sometimes form loose colonies, occupying nests as close as 50 feet apart. They may also share nesting areas with American Crows and Black-billed Magpies. Outside of breeding season, the owls roost in groups of up to 100 birds. Older nestlings are called “branchers” because they leave the nest to take up residence in surrounding trees. They move around by jumping, hopping, and pulling themselves up with wings and bill. Long-eared owls usually form monogamous pairs. Bonding probably begins in winter, before communal roosts disband. Courting males make a complex series of calls and perform an aerial, zigzagging display over suitable nesting habitat, with glides and winbgeats interspersed with wing-claps.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Long-eared Owls typically use stick nests abandoned by other bird species. Less often, they raise their young in cavities in trees or cliffs, in abandoned squirrel nests, or on the ground. Long-eared Owls in Oregon nest have made nests of dwarf mistletoe “brooms”—dense branch profusions that form in response to the mistletoe infection. In Arizona, these owls sometimes nest in crooks of saguaro cactus.",
      "conservation": "Long-eared Owls are fairly common, but their numbers fluctuate from year to year and their population trends are difficult to determine because of their secretive nature and tendency to move nomadically. Populations may be on the decline.Partners in Flightestimates a global breeding population of 520,000 and rates them 12 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of relatively low conservation concern.

They fly with their necks folded in an S-shape, and run or walk with a swaying gait while foraging. Each breeding male defends a display territory, and the breeding pairs later defend a nest territory at the same or a different site. They are usually monogamous within each breeding season, with occasional trios of two females and one male. In elaborate courtship displays, the males spread their wings, fan their plumes, and prance from foot to foot. Nest predators include grackles, crows, owls, Cooper’s Hawks, Black-crowned Night-Herons, and fire ants. Fledgling, juvenile, and adult Western Cattle-Egrets may be hunted by Peregrine Falcons, Great Horned Owls, Barred Owls, raccoons, red foxes, and domestic dogs.Back to top",

Western Cattle-Egrets are native to Africa, and began expanding in the late 1800s, reaching North America in the early 1950s. Western Cattle-Egrets are now established in parts of southern and eastern U.S., and their range is slowly expanding. Their rapid spread stems from versatile feeding and breeding abilities, an aptitude for dispersing to new areas, and changing landscapes: they gained foraging habitat as people converted land for livestock production and crops. Western Cattle-Egrets may benefit the livestock industry by eating flies (and on rare occasions, ticks) from the bodies of cattle. They are sometimes seen as a nuisance because their colonies can be large, noisy, smelly, and close to populated areas. They are sensitive to pollution in water supplies and agricultural fields and accumulate residues of some contaminants in their feathers, leading some researchers to suggest they are a useful species for monitoring levels of environmental pollutants.Back to top"

Colonies of Black-crowned Night Herons are a good indication of overall environmental quality, because night-herons forage at the top of food chain, nest in colonies (where they are fairly easy to study), and have a wide distribution. They tolerate disturbances such as traffic, so they are especially useful for revealing environmental deterioration in urban environments.Back to top"

    "description": "If someone at a park is feeding bread to ducks, chances are there are Mallards in the fray. Perhaps the most familiar of all ducks, Mallards occur throughout North America and Eurasia in ponds and parks as well as wilder wetlands and estuaries. The male’s gleaming green head, gray flanks, and black tail-curl arguably make it the most easily identified duck. Mallards have long been hunted for the table, and almost all domestic ducks come from this species.",
    "cool_facts": [
      "The Mallard is the ancestor of nearly all domestic duck breeds (everything except the Muscovy Duck). Domestic ducks can be common in city ponds and can be confusing to identify—they may lack the white neck ring, show white on the chest, be all dark, or show oddly shaped crests on the head.",
      "The widespread Mallard has given rise to a number of populations around the world that have changed enough that they are considered separate species. The Mexican Duck of central Mexico and the extreme southwestern United States and the Hawaiian Duck both are closely related to the Mallard, and in both forms the male is dull like the female. Both have been given full species status.",
      "Mallard pairs are generally monogamous, but paired males pursue females other than their mates. So-called “extra-pair copulations” are common among birds and in many species are consensual, but male Mallards often force these copulations, with several males chasing a single female and then mating with her.",
      "Mallard pairs form long before the spring breeding season. Pairing takes place in the fall, but courtship can be seen all winter. Only the female incubates the eggs and takes care of the ducklings.",
      "Ducks are strong fliers; migrating flocks of Mallards have been estimated traveling at 55 miles per hour.",
      "The standard duck’s quack is the sound of a female Mallard. Males don’t quack; they make a quieter, rasping sound.",
      "Mallards, like other ducks, shed all their flight feathers at the end of the breeding season and are flightless for 3–4 weeks. They are secretive during this vulnerable time, and their body feathers molt into a concealing “eclipse” plumage that can make them hard to identify.",
      "Many species of waterfowl form hybrids, and Mallards are particularly known for this, hybridizing with American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, Gadwall, Northern Pintail, Cinnamon Teal, Green-winged Teal, and Canvasback, as well as Hawaiian Ducks, Mexican Duck, the Grey Duck of New Zealand, and the Pacific Black Duck of Australia.",
      "The oldest known Mallard was a male, and at least 27 years, 7 months old when he was shot in Arkansas in 2008. He had been banded in Louisiana in 1981."

They also occur in prairie potholes and ephemeral wetlands; they may be found feeding along roadside ditches, pastures, croplands and rice fields.Back to top",
      "food": "Mallards are generalist foragers and will eat a wide variety of food. They don’t dive, but dabble to feed, tipping forward in the water to eat seeds and aquatic vegetation. They also roam around on the shore and pick at vegetation and prey on the ground. During the breeding season, they eat mainly animal matter including aquatic insect larvae, earthworms, snails and freshwater shrimp. During migration, many Mallards consume largely agricultural seed and grain. In city parks, they readily accept handouts from parkgoers.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Mallards are an abundant city and suburban park duck and because of constant feedings by park visitors, they can become very tame and approachable. In more natural settings and where Mallards are heavily hunted, they can be very wary of approaching people. They commonly associate with and may hybridize with other dabbling ducks. Mallards have a huge variety of displays that can be fascinating to watch and decipher. Most displays are ritualized versions of common motions: males may face off with a head-bob, threaten an aggressor with an open bill, or push against each other, breast to breast. Paired males defend their territories with vigorous acrobatic chases. Males court females by shaking or flicking the head side to side, looking over their shoulder, or raising up in the water and flapping their wings. Several males often gather around a female to display. A female encourages a male by nodding her head back and forth or paddling with her head held low.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Mallards nest on the ground on dry land that is close to water; nests are generally concealed under overhanging grass or other vegetation. Occasionally, Mallards nest in agricultural fields, especially alfalfa but also winter wheat, barley, flax, and oats. Both urban and wild populations readily nest in artificial nesting structures. Pairs search for nest sites together, typically on evening flights circling low over the habitat. Occasionally nests are placed on floating mats of vegetation or woven into plant stems that rise out of the water.",
      "conservation": "Mallards are the most widespread and abundant duck in North America and their populations have been steady from 1966 to 2019, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates the North American population at around 19 million breeding birds and rates them 7 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Mallard numbers increase during wet periods and decline when there are droughts in the middle of the continent. Over the last 50 years, their estimated numbers have cycled between about 5 million and 19 million. Mallards are also the most heavily hunted North American ducks, accounting for about 1 of every 3 ducks shot. State and federal wildlife agencies keep close track of the numbers shot. Like other waterfowl, Mallards can be poisoned when they ingest lead shot while feeding. In 1977, a mandatory switch to steel shot along the Mississippi Flyway greatly alleviated lead poisoning in Mallards. This species can also be affected by poor water quality, including mercury, pesticide, and selenium pollution, wetland clearing or drainage, and oil spills.Back to top"

They choose well-vegetated wetlands with plenty of emergent plants to feed among and take cover in. Equally important for breeding are adjacent uplands with vegetation to conceal nests and for ducklings to hide in.  On migration and in winter, look for Gadwalls in fresh and salt water marshes and well-vegetated reservoirs, beaver ponds, farm ponds, and streams.Back to top",
      "food": "Gadwall eat mostly submerged aquatic vegetation such as algae, grasses, rushes, sedges, pondweed, widgeon grass, and water milfoil, including leaves, stems, roots, and seeds. They also eat snails, midges, water beetles, and other invertebrates. During the breeding season, animal matter can account for nearly 50 percent of an adult Gadwall’s diet, but this proportion drops to only about 5 percent animal matter during winter.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Gadwall are dabbling ducks—they ride fairly high in the water and they tip forward to graze on submerged plants that they can reach with their outstretched necks. They rarely dive. Gadwall sometimes steal food from American Coots. Like most ducks they often form flocks, and you may see them fidgeting as they swim about each other. These movements are actually a complex series of displays that communicate pair bonds, levels of aggression, and degrees of interest among potential mates. For example, Gadwall may send warnings to each other off by lifting their chin or opening their bill at another bird. A male may seek a female’s attention by ruffling his head feathers, drawing the head close to the body, and then rearing up out of the water and pushing his head forward. Further courtship displays include the male arching his head over his back and then jerking forward while raising his tail and wing coverts; pushing his bill underwater and then quickly tossing water into the air while whistling; and rearing up while raking his bill through the water and whistling. A female may show her interest by arching her head and neck and repeatedly moving it forward and then to the side away from the male. As the pair bond strengthens, the two birds face each other and raise and lower their heads, chins up; or turn their head and place the bill behind the wing, as if preening. Courtship happens in fall and early winter; virtually all females find mates by November. Gadwall are seasonally monogamous. Predators of eggs and young include California and Ring-billed gulls, Northern Harriers, foxes, weasels, mink, coyotes, and badgers.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Gadwall pairs form during fall migration. Once they return to their breeding grounds, they select their nest site while flying low over dry, grassy areas. The female makes a closer inspection on foot while the male stands guard near her. They typically choose dense brush or grasses at least a foot tall, usually within 200 yards of open water, and nest on islands when possible for greater safety from predators. In heavily cultivated areas, untilled land for nest sites can be a scarce resource.",
      "conservation": "Gadwall populations increased by about 1.7% per year between 1966 and 2019, according to theNorth American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates the global breeding population at 4.4 million individuals and rates them 8 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Gadwall are the third most hunted duck species (after Mallard and Green-winged Teal), with some 1.25 million of them harvested in 2020. Duck harvests are carefully managed, and Gadwall numbers are still strong, in part because of the conservation of both wetlands and adjacent upland nesting habitat through theConservation Reserve Programand theNorth American Waterfowl Management Plan, as well as the efforts of private conservation groups such asDucks Unlimited.Back to top"

Though they are dabbling ducks that usually tip up to feed, they occasionally dive for food and to avoid predators. In winter Green-winged Teal gather in roosting flocks of up to 50,000 birds. Courtship starts in the fall and peaks in January and February; they choose new partners each year. Males try to secure a mate using an elaborate set of movements and vocal displays, with groups of up to 25 males courting females both on the water and in courtship flights. Although most pairs form on the wintering grounds, pair formation continues during spring migration and on the breeding grounds. The male defends its mate from copulation attempts by other males, then deserts the female once incubation is underway. A few hours after they hatch the chicks can swim, dive, walk, and forage for themselves, although the female continues to brood them at night and to protect them when the weather turns cold.Back to top",
      "nesting": "With the male following behind, the female chooses a well-concealed site on the ground, usually within about 200 yards of water. Nests are typically built in sedge meadows, grasslands, brush thickets, or in woods near a pond. The female chooses a spot that offers dense cover that may form a complete canopy over the nest.",
      "conservation": "Green-winged Teal are numerous, and their population increased between 1966 and 2019.Partners in Flightestimates the global breeding population at 6.7 million and rates them 8 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. Most of the population breeds in Canada and Alaska, where relatively remote and inaccessible nesting areas buffer this species from habitat losses farther south caused by agricultural and urban development. Approximately 1.2 to 1.4 million Green-winged Teal were shot in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020. Bag limits for ducks are changed annually based on population size estimates and harvest objectives, helping to safeguard these species against declines.Back to top"

The male's is a dashing curl that echoes the curve of the head and complements his gleaming black-and-white plumage. The female is browner with a shorter, wispier tuft. This common Eurasian species breeds on shallow freshwater lakes, slow rivers, and park ponds. They make short dives to feed on mussels and clams. Wintering birds often form large flocks on both coastal and inland waters. Tufted Ducks regularly stray to North America, where vagrants join scaup and Ring-necked Ducks.",

      "Many birds time their nesting season with the emergence of their insect food. In a study from Scotland, Tufted Ducks laid their eggs just as midge larvae reached their peak on the lake floor. By the time the midges emerged as adults on the lake surface, the ducklings had hatched, ready to feast on them.",
      "Tufted Ducks lay 8-11 eggs in their own nests, but sometimes also lay eggs in their neighbors' nests. It's fairly common in ducks and is known as \"egg dumping.\" This tactic can result in as many as 22 eggs in a single Tufted Duck nest, with that female caring for all the young after they hatch.",
      "Tufted Duck is a rare but regular visitor to North America, with records from 30 U.S. states and all 10 Canadian provinces. These vagrants are usually single birds that associate with flocks of scaup or Ring-necked Ducks."

In Europe, Tufted Ducks are second only to Mallards when it comes to using human-made water bodies like reservoirs, ornamental ponds in city parks, and fishponds.Back to top",
      "food": "Tufted Ducks eat lots of mussels, clams, snails, and other mollusks when they're available. They also eat aquatic plants, crustaceans, aquatic insects, grains, and even potatoes. Tufted Ducks usually dive for their food, spending 20 seconds underwater on average and going 3–14 meters (10–46 feet) deep, but they also dabble for food on the water surface. These ducks can eat larger mussels, but they prefer small mussels—they suck water into their bills, strain out the water, and then crush the small mussels in their gizzard.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Tufted Ducks often gather in large flocks during the winter months, sometimes numbering thousands of birds. When diving, individuals usually start with a quick leap forward. Birds create a splashing sound on the water surface as they take flight, and then produce a whistling sound with their wingbeats.Tufted Ducks are monogamous within a single breeding season, with males and females forming pairs in late winter or early spring. Birds remain paired until the female starts incubating, after which the male goes his own way and rarely helps raise the young. Females care for young birds, often until they fledge at 45–50 days old. When a late nesting season collides with females’ need to molt their flight feathers, they may leave their broods after 29–42 days, at which point the young can normally survive on their own.Back to top",

      "habitat": "Throughout their wide breeding range from Iceland to Siberia, Lesser Black-backed Gulls nest in coastal areas, rocky islands, old lava flows, cliffs, saltmarshes, grassy or sandy islands in lakes and rivers, and even on rooftops. During migration and in winter, they live near rivers, lakes, marshes, estuaries, beaches, fields, and the open ocean. Like Herring Gulls and many other gull species, they sometimes forage at landfills and other locations where food waste is available, including large fishing boats such as trawlers.Back to top",
      "food": "Like all large gull species, Lesser Black-backed Gulls are opportunistic foragers that eat almost anything. Through most of the year, they eat fish and marine invertebrates that they capture by dipping down to the water in flight, swimming, walking, or by stamping their feet rapidly in wet sand to expose small crustaceans. On seashores, they sometimes investigate wrack for prey, flipping over vegetation and rocks as a turnstone does, and they may eat seaweed in the process. They also eat carrion and the eggs and nestlings of other bird species, as well as the occasional rodent. Some Lessers have learned to open mussels and other mollusks by flying high into the air and dropping them on rocks, streets, or sidewalks. Some colonies raise their chicks chiefly on garbage from landfills rather than small fish. In winter, many Lessers follow trawlers to feed on discarded fish and other sea creatures, while others hunt for crayfish in rice fields (in Spain) and eat rice along with earthworms and various insects. They readily eat ripe berries when available, usually near nesting grounds.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Lesser Black-backed Gulls return to breeding grounds in spring, soon after ice and snow have melted. They perform courtship displays but because this species is monogamous and often maintains that bond for several nesting seasons in a row, the displays are sometimes abbreviated. As in other large gull species, female Lessers solicit food from males by rapid upward movements of the bill, similar to a begging chick. Males respond by regurgitating food for her. Male and female maintain their bond by preening each other's head and neck feathers. Once the nest site is established and eggs are laid, the pair exchanges greetings of head-tossing, calling (with neck outstretched), and a display called “choking” (with head down, bill open, as though something were stuck in the throat). Lesser Black-backed Gulls are territorial around the nest, and both adults defend eggs and young. Males especially strike imposing postures and call loudly to warn other males away from the female and the nest. Fights in this species include pecks, pulling wings and tails with bills, and battering with wrists. Pairs usually nest in colonies. Away from the nest area, Lesser Black-backed Gulls are gregarious, gathering in flocks to feed, rest, and preen. During the breeding season, nonbreeding birds usually gather near colonies in “clubs.” When foraging, Lessers often fight over food, scrapping and squabbling when one has a prize morsel, but they, in turn, are often attacked by larger species such as Herring and Great Black-backed Gulls. Nevertheless, Lessers often join large assemblages of gulls and other waterbirds where food is plentiful.Back to top",
      "nesting": "Nests are set on the ground, often on an island or isolated beach, less often on a cliff edge or rooftop.",
      "conservation": "There are small but increasing numbers of Lesser Black-backed Gulls in North America, but little or no nesting here. Worldwide, most populations are stable or increasing. In western Europe and Greenland, the species is increasing in numbers and expanding both its wintering and breeding ranges. Populations of the subspeciesfuscusaround the Baltic Sea declined precipitously, by 75%, between 1970 and 2013. This was due to pesticide poisoning and Herring Gull predation.Partners in Flightestimates a global breeding population of 1 million and rates the species a 9 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score,indicating a species of low conservation concern.Back to top"

They forage over open waters singly, in small groups, or in large flocks with hundreds of terns. They also join feeding groups of Arctic Terns, Roseate Terns, and Laughing Gulls. Common Terns are gregarious and breed in colonies. They court each other in the air and on the ground. In flight the male crouches while the female passes over him until they descend to the ground in a zigzag glide. Courting continues on the ground with the male tipping his head down and holding his wings down and out from the body while walking around the female, who points her head upward. The male starts offering food to the female, eventually feeding her almost exclusively as the pair bond is cemented. Pairs are socially monogamous, but some may seek additional copulations outside the pair, a behavior known as extra-pair copulation. Although they are social terns they aggressively defend their territories. Intruding birds are first met with a \"bent posture\"; adults tip their heads down and hold their wings down and out. Intruders that continue to approach are met with a more aggressive posture with the bill pointed upward and wings held down and out. When posturing fails, adults attack any intruder be it a chick or another adult, often wrestling and fencing with their bills.

However, Common Tern are included in the list ofCommon Birds in Steep Declinefor species that are still too numerous or widely distributed to warrant Watch-List status but have been experiencing troubling long-term declines.During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, people commonly collected tern eggs for food, which likely reduced their populations. But it was hunting for feathers for the millinery trade in the late nineteenth century that reduced the Common Tern population to a few thousand pairs along the Atlantic Coast. Thankfully, their populations rebounded by the 1930s after the Migratory Bird Treaty Act was signed in 1918. Since then, their populations have fluctuated—possibly due to exposure to contaminants such as lead, DDE, and PCB; habitat degradation; climate change; and displacement by gulls. Current populations appear relatively stable, although in some areas of the U.S., the species is declining. Restoration efforts include habitat restoration, predator control, gull removal at breeding colonies, and nest-site protection.Back to top"

    "description": "The exotic Mute Swan is the elegant bird of Russian ballets and European fairy tales. This swan swims with its long neck curved into an S and often holds its wings raised slightly above its back. Although they’re numerous and familiar in city parks and in bays and lakes in the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, Northeast, and Midatlantic, Mute Swans are not native to North America. Their aggressive behavior and voracious appetites often disturb local ecosystems, displace native species, and even pose a hazard to humans.",
    "cool_facts": [
      "All of the Mute Swans in North America descended from swans imported from Europe from the mid 1800s through early 1900s to adorn large estates, city parks, and zoos. Escapees established breeding populations and are now established in the Northeast, Midatlantic, Great Lakes, and Pacific Northwest of the U.S.",
      "Mute Swans form long-lasting pair bonds. Their reputation for monogamy along with their elegant white plumage has helped establish them as a symbol of love in many cultures.",
      "The Mute Swan is reported to mate for life. However, changing of mates does occur infrequently, and swans will remate if their partner dies. If a male loses his mate and pairs with a young female, she joins him on his territory. If he mates with an older female, they go to hers. If a female loses her mate, she remates quickly and usually chooses a younger male.",
      "The black knob at the base of the male Mute Swan's bill swells during the breeding season and becomes noticeably larger than the female's. The rest of the year the difference between the sexes is not obvious.",
      "Downy young Mute Swans (called cygnets) come in two color morphs: a gray form and a white form. The gray (or \"Royal\") chicks start off with gray down and grow in gray-brown and white feathers, giving them a mottled look. White (or \"Polish\") chicks have all white down and juvenal feathers. Adults of the white morph may have pink or gray legs and feet instead of black, but otherwise the adults look alike.",
      "Mute Swans have enormous appetites. A Maryland study found they ate up to 8 pounds a day of submerged aquatic vegetation, removing food and habitat for other species faster than the grasses could recover.",
      "Give plenty of space to nesting Mute Swans. They can be extremely aggressive and frequently attack canoeists, kayakers, and pedestrians who wander too close to a nest or chicks.",
      "Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy taleThe Ugly Ducklingchronicles the woes and triumphs of a young, Mute Swan that hatches in a clutch of duck eggs but goes on to become a beautiful swan. Some speculate that the book was based on Andersen’s own less-than-handsome looks as a youngster.",
      "Mute Swans can adapt to degraded habitat and actually benefit from the spread of the invasive common reedPhragmites australis, which flourishes in disturbed sites. As the reeds spread into lakes and ponds, the swans can build nests farther offshore in the reed beds, where they’re safer from egg predators.",
      "Based on banding records, the oldest known Mute Swan in North America was a male and at least 26 years, 9 months old when he was found in Rhode Island in 1988, the same state where he was banded in 1962."

      "habitat": "The adaptable Mute Swan can be found in aquatic habitats ranging from urban lakes and farm ponds to coastal estuaries. In the Pacific Northwest and from New England south to Virginia, Mute Swan pairs choose fresh, brackish, and saltwater ponds as breeding sites. Farther inland, they breed on slow-moving rivers, bogs, embayments, and creeks and streams that empty into large lakes and other bodies of water. Severe weather or food shortages may drive birds from their territories to winter with nonbreeders in ice-free stretches of lakes, rivers, estuaries, and ocean sounds.Back to top",
      "food": "Mute Swans mainly eat aquatic vegetation, along with some animal prey including frogs, tadpoles, fish, snails, mollusks and insects. In a Michigan study swans ate more animals during their annual molt and in spring when vegetation was scarce. Plant foods include eelgrass, several species of pondweeds, along with filamentous algae, wigeon grass, sea lettuce, bladderwort, flowering grasses, and agricultural grains. They also eat handouts from people, including cracked corn, bread, lettuce, and produce trimmings. Mute Swans are voracious foragers, eating up to 8 pounds of aquatic plants a day that they tear off with their thick, rough-edged bills anchored by strong bill muscles. They skim plants from the surface and submerge all but their tail and feet to reach vegetation growing in deeper water. They also rake the bottom with their feet to expose tubers and dig up plants to bring to the surface.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Short legs placed well back on the body give Mute Swans an awkward walking gait, but the birds can run quickly if pursued and can take off from land and water, flying with head and neck extended. On the water they sometimes hold their wings slightly raised and “sail” with the wind. Mute Swans are predominantly monogamous and form long-lasting breeding pairs. They are extremely aggressive in defending their breeding territory. Before or during landing at a breeding site they’ll slap the water with their feet to announce their arrival and alert potential intruders. If another swan approaches members of the pair raise their wings and tuck their neck in a “busking” display to warn them off. Territorial defenses sometimes escalate to fights between males that can end with the dominant bird pushing its rival underwater. Mute swans also chase off ducks, geese, gulls, dogs, and humans. The aggressive nature and enormous appetites of these nonnative birds pose a problem for wildlife managers: Mute Swans displace native species from breeding and foraging sites, and can damage feeding habitat by overgrazing aquatic vegetationBack to top",
      "nesting": "Male Mute Swans select the nest site and may start several nests before the female accepts the location. Nest sites are safe from flooding yet offer easy access to water, with ample nesting materials and food nearby - often on a small peninsula, along a heavily vegetated shoreline, or on a small to medium-sized island.",
      "conservation": "Mute Swan populations held steady between 1966 and 2019, according to theNorth American Breeding Bird Survey.Partners in Flightestimates the global breeding population at 400,000 and rates them 7 out of 20 on theContinental Concern Score, indicating a species of low conservation concern. With few natural predators, these aggressive nonnatives can increase their population quickly, displace native species, and damage aquatic habitat by overgrazing vegetation, creating a dilemma for wildlife and habitat managers. In the Maryland region of Chesapeake Bay, Mute Swans drove the last colony of Black Skimmers off their breeding grounds and trampled Least Tern nests and nestlings on the bay’s sandbars. Mute Swans are also displacing Black Tern colonies in New York. Some states have adopted measures—including addling eggs and culling birds—to control Mute Swan numbers, but these measures tend to generate public controversy. In Maryland, a population of over 4,000 had been reduced to fewer than 100 swans by 2012. Control efforts are also in place in the Central and Pacific Flyways, where wildlife managers are removing Mute Swans in efforts to reestablish Trumpeter Swan populations. Due in part to poor forward vision and maneuverability, Mute Swans are injured and killed by impacts with power lines and other structures. They are also affected by lead poisoning from spent shot and fishing weights.Back to top"

During the breeding season, they are territorial and generally associate only with their family group, but during the winter they forage in groups often with American Coots and ducks. Common Gallinules can form long-lasting pairs, but sometimes males mate with more than one female.

The Hawaiian subspecies is endangered in Hawaii due to habitat loss and predation by introduced predators such as rats, mongoose, cats, and dogs. Threats to Common Gallinules in North America are not well known. In some areas loss of wetland habitat may threaten them, but in other areas populations have grown, taking advantage of newly created marshy areas such as retention ponds and rice fields. In North America Common Gallinules are hunted in several states, but the impacts due to hunting are unclear because available hunting data lump Purple and Common Gallinule species together.Back to top"

      "SomeNorthern Wheatears are champion migrantsthat cross much of the Northern Hemisphere each year on their way to nonbreeding grounds in sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, North American wheatears get to Africa by two very different and very grueling routes. Breeders in Alaska and Yukon migrate some 14,500 km (9,000 miles) across Asia, while breeders in eastern Canada and Greenland fly nonstop for 3–4 days across the North Atlantic.",
      "Northern Wheatear’s scientific name,Oenanthe oenanthe, combines Greek words for “wine” and “flower,” alluding to its return to Greece as grapevines are blossoming in spring. The common name “wheatear” refers to the conspicuous white rump of this species.",
      "During the nonbreeding season in Africa, Northern Wheatears seek out large evergreen trees to stay cool in the shade during the hottest part of the day.",
      "Feeding chicks is a full-time job that just gets more demanding with more daylight. In Sweden, Greenland, and northern Canada, where the summer sun only briefly dips below the horizon, adults feed nestlings over a span of 19–20 hours each day."

Breeding habitats include short meadow, grazed pasture, dry arctic tundra with rock outcrops or boulder fields, and other settings with short vegetation and scattered rocks and boulders. Nonbreeding birds in sub-Saharan Africa occur in short-grass acacia steppe, savanna with limited trees, barren rocky areas, open fields, and cultivated areas.Back to top",
      "food": "Northern Wheatears feed primarily on insects taken from the ground. During the breeding season, adult and larval beetles, moths, butterflies, bees, wasps, and ants are common prey, among many other invertebrates. In late summer and fall, as birds prepare for migration, they add berries to their diet. Northern Wheatears forage on or near the ground, in areas with bare earth or short vegetation. They commonly hop or run in short bursts, and then pause to survey the area or peck at insects. They also scan from low perches before swooping down on prey.Back to top",
      "behavior": "Northern Wheatears hop on the ground (rather than walk) and fly in an undulating pattern. When agitated, they wag their tails and bob their bodies up and down. At rest, Northern Wheatears have a horizontal posture that makes them appear compact and plump, but when alarmed, they shift to an erect posture that gives a tall, long-legged look. This species is highly territorial, with individuals establishing territories on migration and nonbreeding grounds in addition to breeding grounds. Males are extremely aggressive toward each other, displaying aggressively with their white rump and white-and-black tails, and occasionally coming to physical blows. Northern Wheatears also attack other songbird species, both on migration and during nesting season.Northern Wheatears typically form monogamous pair bonds that last for a single breeding season, but males sometimes have two mates simultaneously. Females build the nest and incubate the eggs. Both sexes feed the nestlings, which typically fledge after 15–16 days. A few days after the young birds fledge, the parents often divide feeding responsibilities, and the fledglings quickly learn which parent will feed them and which one will not.Back to top",
      "nesting": "The female builds the nest in a cavity, frequently in a rock crevice or animal burrow (in Europe, they often use rabbit burrows). Wheatears also use many human-made cavities, including under roof tiles, in pipes, and in crevices on the outside of buildings. They don't typically use nest boxes.",
      "conservation": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists Northern Wheatear’s conservation status asLeast Concerndue to an extremely large range and extremely large population size (estimated at 10–500 million individuals). In Europe, however, the species has declined markedly, disappearing from some areas in western Europe where it was formerly widespread. The European breeding population declined 3.65% per year from 1980 to 2009, for an overall decrease of 66% over those three decades. Habitat loss (due to agriculture and urbanization), changes in agricultural practices, and declines in European rabbit populations (which provide nesting sites and help maintain ideal wheatear habitat) have all contributed to Northern Wheatear declines in Europe.Back to top"
